# Superstore Sales Analysis: SQL and Python Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore Sales dataset. The primary goal is to uncover key sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using a combination of SQL for data querying and Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

The analysis focuses on understanding:
* Overall sales distribution across different product categories.
* Identification of top-performing customers.
* Monthly sales trends to observe seasonality and growth patterns.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the `train.csv` dataset, which contains detailed information about sales transactions from a Superstore. Key columns include:
* `Order_ID`, `Order_Date`, `Ship_Date`, `Ship_Mode`
* `Customer_ID`, `Customer_Name`, `Segment`
* `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal_Code`, `Region`
* `Product_ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product_Name`
* `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit` (though not all used in this specific analysis, they are available in the dataset)

## Methodology

This project utilizes a hybrid approach, combining the power of SQL for efficient data querying and Python for robust data processing and visualization:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The `train.csv` dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Database Integration:** The DataFrame is then loaded into a SQLite database (`superstore.db`) for SQL-based querying.
3.  **SQL Querying:** Various SQL queries are executed against the SQLite database to extract summarized data for analysis (e.g., total sales by category, top customers, monthly sales).
4.  **Python Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas is used to process the query results, and Matplotlib along with Seaborn are employed to create insightful visualizations.
5.  **Result Export:** Key analytical summaries are exported to CSV files for further use or sharing.

## Key Insights and Visualizations

The EDA revealed several important insights, visualized through the following plots:

### 1. Total Sales by Product Category
A bar plot illustrating the total sales generated by each product category (e.g., Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies). This helps in identifying the most profitable categories.

### 2. Top 10 Customers by Sales
A bar plot showcasing the top 10 customers based on their total purchase value. This highlights high-value customers who contribute significantly to sales.

### 3. Monthly Sales Trend
A line plot depicting the total sales over time on a monthly basis. This visualization helps in identifying sales seasonality, growth trends, or periods of decline.

## SQL Queries Used

Below are examples of the SQL queries executed to derive the insights:

### Total Sales by Product Category
```sql
SELECT Category, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
